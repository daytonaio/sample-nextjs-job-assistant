## Introduction
Ex-Cons Thrive is a project designed to help formerly incarcerated individuals reintegrate into society by providing job search assistance, legal support, mental health services, and more. This project draws inspiration from the hardships faced by ex-convicts during reintegration, including the stigma, lack of opportunities, and legal barriers that often limit their options. It makes use of Llama3-8b-8192 and Mixtral-8x7b-32768 AI model.

## Problem Statement

Ex-convicts often face significant challenges when reintegrating into society, particularly in finding stable employment. Many encounter barriers such as:

1. **Stigma and Discrimination**: Employers may have preconceived notions about hiring individuals with criminal records, leading to bias in the hiring process.

2. **Lack of Relevant Experience**: Ex-convicts may struggle to translate their past experiences into marketable skills, making it difficult to compete in the job market.

3. **Limited Access to Resources**: Many individuals lack access to information about job opportunities, training programs, and support networks that could aid their reintegration.

4. **Legal Restrictions**: Some ex-convicts may face restrictions on the types of employment they can pursue based on their criminal history, complicating their job search.

The Ex-Cons Thrive project aims to address these challenges by providing a personalized job assistance platform that leverages advanced AI models to offer tailored job suggestions based on individual experiences, skills, and needs. The goal is to empower ex-convicts with the resources and support they need to successfully reintegrate into society and build fulfilling careers.
